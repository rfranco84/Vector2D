# Vector2D
C++ Class for 2D vectors capable of doing basic vector operations with various operators being overloaded.

Developed in Visual Studio 2019.

Vector2D.cpp contains the main function and is used to test the Vector2 class.

Use the + operator to add two Vector2 objects
For example:
v+u

The - and * operators work similarly. The * operator will compute the dot product.
